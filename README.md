# ESP8266-nonos-start

Starting point for ESP8266 projects that use the Non-RTOS SDK (e.g. nonos-sdk) This has been copied from `~/.platformio/platforms/espressif8266/examples/esp8266-nonos-sdk-blink` and tweaked a bit before first commit.

## Plan

Add support for WiFi, NTP, MQTT and perhaps analog inputs.

## Status
